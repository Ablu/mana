                             === SKILLS ===

 You can improve your skills by increasing job level. Each job level
 gives you 1 point to spend on basic skills.

     Level 1: enables the ability to trade with others
     Level 2: enables the ability to express emotions
     Level 3: enables character to sit

 Other levels are still not implemented.
