##3                      === ABOUT Aethyra ===
 
 ##2Aethyra (Ae)##P Aethyra is a 2D MMORPG, using the eAthena server 
 (an open-source clone of the commercial Ragnarok Online server). It
 features expanding lands and community-made graphics, making for a 
 fun, free, open source community project.

 ##PAethyra started out as "The Mana Experiment," an experimental 
 test-server for community-developed content designed for The Mana 
 World which was put into action by Blame, Sanga, and Sertaline.
 ##PSoon thereafter, it became evident that it was taking far too 
 long for the elitist development team at The Mana World to 
 implement good tested-content. They made excuses and treated the
 long-awaited custom server TMWServ as the answer to all the problems,
 and left the eAthena server (which The Mana World still runs on) 
 to rot. Many development team members lost interest in helping, and 
 the programmers forsook the eAthena server saying that it would 
 simply delay TMWServ progress for months to fix the simplest of 
 errors. In response to this, The Mana Experiment became a fork 
 project, and an official game server. 
 ##PTime passed, and more and more content was tested and implemented.
 Soon, discussion began for a name. Aethyra was chosen, and the Game 
 you see now was setup. Content development has never been better, and
 the staff never more motivated! Stay on the lookout for more exciting
 Aethyra developments!

##3                     === Aethyra's Goal ===

 ##PAethyra is a community driven experiment that utilizes eAthena at 
 its core with the end goal of getting its players as involved in the
 process as much as possible.  It's originally forked from The Mana
 World when its developers came up with the idea of "Why should we
 have to wait for an MMORPG game in development when we've already got
 a great server setup here that does everything we've been promised
 and more?" ##P As such, we are trying to implement as many functions
 of eAthena as possible while creating our own in the process based
 on what our players want to see.
