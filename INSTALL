1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out Aethyra from CVS or you have downloaded
a source release. To get Aethyra to compile, you need a compiler
(GCC) and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* Guichan 0.8.x     http://guichan.sourceforge.net/
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* physfs 1.0.x      http://icculus.org/physfs/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

<<<<<<< HEAD:INSTALL
If you checked Aethyra out from Subversion you will also need these tools to
compile:
=======
If you've cloned the Git repository, you will also need these tools to compile:
>>>>>>> a7c21e6f8add37af7412449742ec55c8daa8571a:INSTALL

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing Aethyra
===============================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
<<<<<<< HEAD:INSTALL
2) If you checked out from SVN, run "./autobuild.sh" to install the client.
=======
2) If you've cloned the Git repository, run "autoreconf -i" to generate
   configure and install any missing auxiliary files.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root
>>>>>>> a7c21e6f8add37af7412449742ec55c8daa8571a:INSTALL

It should have installed Aethyra on your system now, and you can
run it with "aethyra". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can
pass a different prefix to configure as usual.

    NOTE: if the autobuild.sh fails 
	1.) ./autogen.sh
	2.) ./configure
	3.) make
	4.) su -c "make install"

	you can get help from A.) IRC channel  irc.freenode.net #aedev or #aethyra
			      B.) http://forum.aethyra.com
	Make sure you record the output from the konsole window

  NOTE: It is possible to compile Aethyra without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --without-opengl

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".
