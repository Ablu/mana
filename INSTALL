1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out TMW from CVS or you have downloaded
a source release. To get The Mana World to compile, you need a compiler (GCC)
and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* Guichan 0.6.0     http://guichan.sourceforge.net/
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* physfs 1.0.x      http://icculus.org/physfs/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

If you checked TMW out from CVS you will also need these tools to compile:

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing The Mana World
==========================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you checked out from SVN, run "./autogen.sh" to generate configure.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed The Mana World on your system now, and you can run it
with "tmw". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can pass a
different prefix to configure as usual.


  NOTE: For those people with modern video cards and fast OpenGL performance,
  we have been working on OpenGL support. At the moment there is no way to
  switch between SDL and OpenGL dynamically and you need to do this at compile
  time. To try this perform step 3 as follows:

    "./configure --with-opengl"

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".
