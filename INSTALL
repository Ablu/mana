1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out Aethyra from CVS or you have downloaded
a source release. To get Aethyra to compile, you need a compiler
(GCC) and some libraries. The required libraries are:

* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL_net           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
* Guichan 0.8.x     http://guichan.sourceforge.net/
* libxml2           http://www.xmlsoft.org/
* physfs 1.0.x      http://icculus.org/physfs/
* zlib 1.2.x        http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
* libcurl           http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

If you checked Aethyra out from Subversion you will also need these tools to
compile:

* GNU automake 1.9  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
* GNU autoconf      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling And Installing Aethyra
===============================================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you checked out from SVN, run "./autogen.sh" to generate configure.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"
5) Run "make install" as root

It should have installed Aethyra on your system now, and you can
run it with "aethyra". By default all files are installed to /usr/local, you can
pass a different prefix to configure as usual.


  NOTE: It is possible to compile Aethyra without support for OpenGL rendering.
  To do this perform step 3 as follows:

    ./configure --without-opengl

  Rebuild the executable from scratch using "make clean" and then "make".
