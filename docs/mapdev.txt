Because it wouldn't be convenient if everybody fixed every small map error he
encounters, instead one can add it to this list and a mapper can include the
fixes the next time he updates the map. Suggestions can be done here as well.

Errors:
 * The new desert map:
     - The blocked exit to the east is not well made. A character gets himself up on the hills while going right. Just a few sand tiles to add in the "over" layer.
     - Some Walls have to be retested to the west against the left hill. The character has sometimes a strange behaviour while walking along that wall.

Suggestions:
- The large empty area at 44,34 in new_3-1 is reserved for the city's "palace"
- Place some more rock ridges in new_1-1
