Because it wouldn't be convenient if everybody fixed every small map error he
encounters, instead one can add it to this list and a mapper can include the
fixes the next time he updates the map. Suggestions can be done here as well.

Errors:
- No known errors

Suggestions:
- The large empty area at 44,34 in new_3-1 is reserved for the city's "palace"
- Place some more rock ridges in new_1-1
