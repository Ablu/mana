Because it wouldn't be convenient if everybody fixed every small map error he
encounters, instead one can add it to this list and a mapper can include the
fixes the next time he updates the map. Suggestions can be done here as well.

Errors:
 * The new desert map (1-1):
     - Some Walls have to be retested to the west against the left hill. The character has sometimes a strange behaviour while walking along that wall, and that doesn't seem to be linked with the map. Or am I wrong?

Suggestions:
- The large empty area at 44,34 in new_3-1 is reserved for the city's "palace"
