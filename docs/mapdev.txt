Cause it wouldn't be convenient if everybody fixed every small map error he
encounters, instead one can add it to this list and a mapper can include the
fixes the next time he updates the map. Suggestions can be done here as well.

Errors:
- House roof in too low layer at 103,24 in new_3-1
- Palm in too low layer at 65,66 in new_3-1

Suggestions:
- The large empty area at 44,34 in new_3-1 is reserved for the city's "palace"
