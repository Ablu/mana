How to build a .deb for TMW on Ubuntu
=====================================

This documentation is for those who are interested in building the .deb files
of The Mana World. Most people do not need to do this, but can instead use the
repository. You can find information about how to use the repository on our
downloads page.


1. Installing the dependencies
==============================

First of all you need a working compiler and package building environment. If
you don't have this yet, install the following packages:

   apt-get install gcc g++ dh-make fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essentials

In order to compile The Mana World, you'll need the developer packages for
SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, SDL_net, libxml2, libphysfs and libguichan0.

   apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev ...

(todo: add missing entries)
(todo: include information about installing Guichan development package)


2. Creating the .debs using DebHelper Tools
===========================================

Either download the source release of TMW that you want to build a package for,
or check out the appropriate version from Subversion, for example by using the
tag.

Make sure the files in the debian directory are up to date. You can do this by
checking out the appropriate directory from Subversion (will be either
tmw/branches/0.0/debian or tmw/trunk/debian for the latest release).

Now we can build the packages using the following command.

   fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

The packages will be created in the parent folder.
