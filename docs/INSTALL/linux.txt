1. Requirements
===============

You are expected to have either checked out TMW from CVS or you have downloaded
a source release. To get The Mana World to compile, you need a compiler (GCC)
and some libraries. The required libraries are:

1) SDL             http://www.libsdl.org/
2) SDL_mixer       http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
3) SDL_image       http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
4) Guichan 0.2.0   http://guichan.darkbits.org/
5) libxml2         http://www.xmlsoft.org/

If you checked TMW out from CVS you will also need these to compile:

6) GNU automake    http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
7) GNU autoconf    http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Compiling The Mana World
===========================

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) If you checked out from CVS, run "./autogen.sh" to generate configure.
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"

It should have generated the executable in src/tmw, you should run it like
"src/tmw" for it to be able to find its data.

If this does not work for you try the following: (not recommend)

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) Run "make -f makefile.static"

Now you should be able to run "./tmw".

If you have any problems, you are welcome to post your questions on our forums,
or talk about them in our IRC channel.
