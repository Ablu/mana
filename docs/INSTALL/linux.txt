1. Requirements
===============

To get The Mana World to compile, you need a compile (GCC) and some libraries.
The required libraries are:

1) SDL             http://www.libsdl.org/
2) SDL_mixer       http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
3) SDL_image       http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
4) Guichan 0.2.0   http://guichan.darkbits.org/

Installing these dependencies is distributions-specific, and we'll leave it to
you to figure this out.


2. Installing The Mana World
============================

The final step... I assume you have already downloaded the latest tarball or
checked out a recent version from the CVS. 
In any case follow the last 3 steps: (recommend)

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) Run "./autogen.sh" (only when using CVS, not when using a source release)
3) Run "./configure"
4) Run "make"

It should have generated the executable in src/tmw, you should run it from the
main directory for it to be able to find its data.

If this does not work for you try the following: (not recommend)

1) Go to the directory you have extracted the source to.
2) Run "make -f makefile.static"

Now you should be able to run "./tmw".

If you have any problems, you are welcome to post your questions on our forums,
or talk about them in our IRC channel.
