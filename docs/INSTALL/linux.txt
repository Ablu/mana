The Mana World project
======================
Homepage: themanaworld.sourceforge.net
IRC:      irc.freenode.net / #manaworld

1) Requirements
2) Installing the Allegro library
3) Installing the Alfont library
4) Installing the JGmod library
5) Installing The Mana World
6) Notes

1. Requirements
===============

First of all you need a working installation of your favorite GNU/Linux
distribution. I recommend Debian Sarge/Sid or ArchLinux but you won't listen
to what i say anyway, eh? ;-)

Second you need to have a working version of GCC with the C and C++ compiler
available. Simply run this to test your if it is installed:
  For the C compiler:   gcc -v
  For the C++ compiler: g++ -v
  
Both should state a version and other stuff, if not found install them
both first. Those should be included in any distribution.

To get The Mana World to compile, some libraries are needed:

1) Allegro 4.1+
2) Alfont  1.91
3) JGmod 0.99

2) Installing the Allegro Libraries
===================================

Look for a package for the distribution you run first and if you find a
version of Allegro 4.1 or higher you can save the time to go through the
next steps and skip to section 3. If not read ahead!

Download Allegro:
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/alleg/allegro-4.1.14.tar.gz?download
  
Follow the steps:
1) cd into the path you donwloaded the tarball to
2) run "tar xzf allegro-4.1.14.tar.gz"
3) cd into "allegro-4.1.14"
4) run "./configure && make"
5) then make sure you are the superuser and run "make install"
6) run "ldconfig -v | grep allegro"
    This should output exaclty one line:
      "/usr/local/lib/allegro/4.1:"
    If not check where it was installed to and add the path to your ld
    config file and run the above command again.

Allegro should now be installed on your system. If libraries are missing
or something else doesn't work out please correspond to Allegros installation
manual:
  http://alleg.sourceforge.net/
  
3) Installing the Alfont library
================================

This is most likely not included in any distribution out there. So download
the source from here:
  http://nekros.freeshell.org/delirium/alfont.php
  
1) extract the archive, i recommend unzip :-)
2) cd into the directory
3) edit "Makefile" so it looks like this:
  
  [..]
    # Makefile for AllegroFont using FreeType 2
    
    # select (uncomment) one target and comment DJGPP if you are not aiming
    # for that platform
    #TARGET=DJGPP_STATIC
    #TARGET=MINGW32_STATIC
    #TARGET=MINGW32_DLL
    TARGET=LINUX_STATIC
  [..]
4) run "sh fixunix.sh"
5) run "make"
6) make sure you're the superuser and do the following:
  cp lib/linux/libalfont.a /usr/lib
  cp include/* /usr/include
  ldconfig
7) this should finish the Alfont installation

4) Installing the JGmod library
TODO

5. Installing The Mana World
============================

The final step... I assume you have already downloaded the latest tarball
or checked out a recent version from the CVS. In any case follow the last
3 steps:

1) cd into the directory you have extracted the source to
2) run a simple "make"
3) This should have been it! Now you should be able to run "./ManaWorld"
   and play the game. If not you are welcome to post your questions on
   the TMW forums:

6. Notes
========

I only tested this on Archlinux Current (13th July 2004) and Debian Sid
(13th July 2004) with the most recent packages installed.

If you have any comments regarding this installation howto feel free to
contact me using the stated email-address on the top of this document.
But please try the TMW IRC channel first.

That's all folks! Have a nice day! :-)
