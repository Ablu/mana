1. Requirements
===============

In this tutorial we will use Dev-C++ because of the fact that it's a very good
free IDE for Win32 built around GCC. Remember, Win32 was not meant for GCC and
stuff so you will probably run into trouble unless you really know what you're
doing, so best stick with Dev-C++.

Besides a C++ compiler, TMW depends on the following libraries:

1) SDL
2) SDL_mixer
3) SDL_image
4) Guichan 0.2.0
5) libxml2


2. Installing Dev-C++
=====================

I recommend that you get the latest beta version, which is 4.9.9.1 at the time
of writing. Though this tutorial is written for and tested with that, it may
also apply to the latest stable version. Get Dev-C++ here:

  http://www.bloodshed.net/
  
After you fetched it simply run and install.


3. Installing the required libraries
====================================

The easy way is to get our development package which should work with the latest
CVS (I'll try to update it as much as I can).
You can find it at:

         http://themanaworld.sourceforget.net/files/tmw-cvs.DevPak

Just install this one and you should be ready to go. Remember to copy the required
dlls from your dll folder in the Dev-Cpp root directory, to the folder where you
have your copy of The Mana World.
If you can't get the package or experiencing problems with it, just send me an
email at elvenprogrammer@gmail.com or continue reading.

All the libs have DevPaks that are very easy drop-ins for Dev-C++, without any
complex actions on your side.

Get the following list of DevPaks:

- SDL           (http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=57)
- SDL_mixer     (http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=26)
- SDL_image     (http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=25)
- Guichan       (http://guichan.darkbits.org/downloads/guichan-0.2.0.DevPak)
- libxml2 **    (ftp://ftp.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/)

Install them all through the Dev-C++ package manager. For SDL_image you may
still need to manually get the SDL_image.lib file from the SDL_image homepage
(devel VC6 zip file) and copy it to your Dev-Cpp/lib directory.

**) For libxml2, download the following files (these or newer versions):

        libxml2-2.6.17.win32.zip
        iconv-1.9.1.win32.zip
        zlib-1.2.1.win32.zip

    From each file, copy the headers to your include directory, the libs to
    the lib direcotry and the dlls (in bin direcotry) to your tmw directory.

You should now be fully equipped for compiling the latest TMW CVS code!


4. Compiling The Mana World
===========================

Check out The Mana World from CVS using either the command line cvs tool or
TortoiseCVS, pick what you like to use most and install that. Next, check out
the tmw module from our repository. For anonymous users, the CVSROOT is:

  :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/themanaworld

Open "The Mana World.dev" in Dev-C++. From there on you should be able to
start compilition with Excute -> Compile. A file called tmw.exe should appear
in the same directory as where you opened the .dev from.

Before you can actually run the executable be sure to copy over the following
DLLs from your Dev-Cpp/dll directory to the directory containing tmw.exe:

 SDL.dll
 SDL_image.dll
 SDL_mixer.dll
 guichan.dll
 guichan_sdl.dll
 jpeg.dll
 libpng1.dll
 zlib1.dll

And also make sure you have:

 libxml2.dll
 iconv.dll

Have fun hacking The Mana World!
