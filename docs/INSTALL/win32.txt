1. Requirements
===============

In this tutorial we will use DevC++ because of the fact that it's a very good
free IDE for Win32 built around GCC. Remember, Win32 was not meant for GCC and
stuff so you will probably run into trouble unless you really know what you're
doing, so best stick with Dev-C++.

Besides a C++ compiler, TMW depends on the following libraries:

1) Allegro 4.1.x
2) Alfont  1.91
3) JGmod 0.99
4) Guichan 0.1.0


2. Installing Dev-C++
=====================

I recommend that you get the latest beta version, which is 4.9.9.1 at the time
of writing. Though this tutorial is written for and tested with that, it may
also apply to the latest stable version. Get Dev-C++ here:

  http://www.bloodshed.net/
  
After you fetched it simply run and install.


3. Installing the required libraries
====================================

All the libs have DevPaks that are very easy drop-ins for Dev-C++, without any
complex actions on your side.

Get the following list of DevPaks:

- Allegro       (http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=2)
- AllegroFont   (http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=88)
- JGMOD         (http://devpaks.org/show.php?devpak=121)
- Guichan       (http://sull.homelinux.net/~ardaen/guichan.DevPak)

Install them all through the Dev-C++ package manager. Special thanks to Ardaen
for providing us with a static DevPak for Guichan.

You should now be fully equipped for compiling the latest TMW CVS code!


4. Compiling The Mana World
===========================

Check out The Mana World from CVS using either the command line cvs tool or
TortoiseCVS, pick what you like to use most and install that. Next, check out
the tmw module from our repository. The CVSROOT is:

  :pserver:anoncvs@sull.homelinux.net:/var/home/cvs/repository

Open "The Mana World.dev" in Dev-C++. From there on you should be able to
start compilition with Excute -> Compile. A file called tmw.exe should appear
in the same directory as where you opened the .dev from.

Before you can actually run the executable be sure to copy over alleg41.dll
from your Dev-Cpp/dll directory to the directory containing tmw.exe.

Have fun hacking The Mana World!
