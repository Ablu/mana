1. Requirements
===============

In this tutorial we will use DevC++ b/c of the fact that
it's a free and one of best - if not THE best - IDE you
can get on Win32. Remember, Win32 was not meant for GCC
and stuff so you will probably run into trouble unless
you really know what you're doing, so best stick with
Dev-C++.

Furthermore TMW depends on the following libraries:

1) Allegro 4.1.x
2) Alfont  1.91
3) JGmod 0.99


2. Installing Dev-C++
=====================

I recommend that you get the latest stable version. Though
this tutorial is written for and tested w/ Dev-C++ 4.9.90
it may also apply to any later version. Get 4.9.90 here:

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp4990setup.exe
  
After you fetched it simply run and install. As soon as it is
installed you need to adjust a couple of enviroment-variables.
I will assume that you know how to do this.

If you have Dev-C++ installed to "C:\Dev-Cpp" - the default -
your envars should contain these:

SET PATH=C:\Dev-Cpp\bin;C:\otherpaths
SET MINGDIR=C:\Dev-Cpp

Don't worry this won't hurt your Win32 unless you replace the
contents of PATH. ;-)


3. Updating Dev-C++ and Allegro installation
=====================

Since the GCC in Dev-C++ is pretty old, we should get something
newer. This - fortunately - is not very hard to do. Simply fo to
"Tools" and then to "Check for Upgrades/Packages".
This will give you the Webupdate dialog where you should click
on the "Check for upgrades" button.
When you see the list  look for "g++-3.4.1" and "gcc-core-3.4.1"
in the group "Dev-C++ MINGW System". After you have done that,
select the group you might want to check out a group called
"Allegro"! ;-)
