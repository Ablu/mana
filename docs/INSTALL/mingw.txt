Windows The Mana World Developers Getting Started Howto (MinGW + MSYS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Get the MinGW 3.1.0 from http://www.mingw.org/

* Get MSYS 1.0.1 from there too

* Install MinGW

* Install MSYS (and do the normalization with MinGW it comes up with)

* Get Allegro 4.1.17 from http://alleg.sf.net/

* Install Allegro in MSYS, following MinGW32+MSYS installation instructions
  in docs/build/mingw32.txt

* Get Guichan 0.1.0 from http://guichan.darkbits.org

  * After unzipping, change _declspec to __declspec in the following file:
  
    include/guichan/platform.hpp:59

  * In MSYS, do "export HAVE_ALLEGRO=yes" to get the Guichan configure to
    believe Allegro is present (which should be now)

  * For Guichan, run

    ./configure --prefix=/mingw --disable-sdl --disable-opengl

    This stops it from trying to build the unwanted parts and makes it install
    the includes and libraries in the right place.

  * Finish off with "make" and "make install"

* Get alfont from http://nekros.freeshell.org/delirium/alfont.php

  * In MSYS in alfont directory, run ./fixunix.sh

  * Change the target in the Makefile to MINGW32_STATIC by uncommenting the
    line and commenting the DJGPP one.

  * Run make

  * Copy the resulting .a file from lib/mingw32 to /mingw/lib
  * Copy the includes from include to /mingw/include

* Get jgmod from http://surf.to/jgmod

  * In MSYS, go into the jgmod/src dir and type make

  * Copy jgmod/lib/djgpp/libjgmod.a over to /mingw/lib
  * Copy src/jgmod.h over to /mingw/include

* Now you're ready for The Mana World. Start with checkout out the latest
  source from CVS. CVS root is
  ":pserver:sull.homelinux.net:/var/home/cvs/repository" and module is "tmw".
  TortoiseCVS is a useful CVS client that integrates with Windows Explorer.
  (http://www.tortoisecvs.org/)

* In MSYS go to the tmw directory, and run

  make -f makefile.mgw

  This should compile you a working tmw.exe, seems to be statically linked.
  To make it a bit smaller (towards 850k) you can do

  strip tmw.exe

  Might be a good idea to include that in the makefile.
