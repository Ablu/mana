1. Installing The Mana World Dependancies
=============================================

The Mana World Debian Package can be installed under the Debian Testing and
Unstable (Sarge/Cid). In order to have Mana World working, you'll need packages
for Allegro, SDL, SDL_mixer and Guichan.

To install liballegro4.1, you can do type (as root):
	apt-get install liballegro4.1

Also make sure you install the other required packages.

2. Make the latest Mana World Debian Package and install it
==========================================================

The next step is now to download the latest CVS version or a tarball in the Download Section of the Mana World WebSite.
(I think you've got it because you're reading this file which is included in, right !)

you must have gcc and g++ installed, and also liballegro-dev.
Don't forget them :
	apt-get install gcc g++ liballegro-dev
	
Now open a shell and go in the root of the new extracted tarball. You should see a file named GenDeb.sh.
Become root,
Make it executable :
	chmod +x GenDeb.sh
And now create the Debian Package !!! :
	./GenDeb.sh
	
Let it work : and TADAM !
The new package should be in the same directory as GenDeb.sh and should be named :
	manaworld_XXXXXX_i386.deb (XXXXXX is the version number...)
Install it :
	dpkg -i manaworld_XXXXXX_i386.deb
(If you've got a previous one already installed with the same version number, don't forget to remove it with :)
	apt-get remove manaworld
	(Don't worry, you configuratio files are not removed...)
	
And now the final step : type 'manaworld' as a normal user in a shell and you're in !!!

(Don't forget : To create a new account, add a '_M' after your account name the first time. After that just type your account name normally...)
