3) Notes


1. Installing The Mana Experiment and Dependencies
=============================================

The Mana Experiment Debian Package can be installed under the Debian Testing and
Unstable (Sarge/Sid). In order to have Mana Experiment working, you'll need
packages for SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, libxml2, libphysfs and libguichan0.

To install the dependencies, you can do type (as root):

    apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-image1.2 libxml2 libphysfs-1.0-0 libguichan0

Type tmw as a normal user to play! (Enjoy!)

2. Creating a Debian Package using DebHelper Tools
==================================================

You'll need the gcc, g++ and dev packages of dependencies:

   apt-get install gcc g++ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev

And the debhelper tools:

   apt-get install dh-make fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essentials

Download tmw from Subversion using the command (You'll need Subversion
installed on your system):

   svn svn://209.168.213.109 tme

Rename the tme folder into tme-XXX and open a console in it.
You can now type:

    fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

The package will create itself, including sources and diffs. You only need deb
file.

Install it:

    dpkg -i tme_XXXXXX_i386.deb

(If you've got a previous one already installed with the same version number,
don't forget to remove it with :)

    apt-get remove tme

(Don't worry, you configuration files are not removed...)

And now the final step: type 'tme' as a normal user in a shell and you're in!

KDE/GNOME menu entries are created in Arcade Games upon installation.

3. Notes
========

A Debian Repository has been created.

Simply add in your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

    deb http://bertram.ifrance.com ./
    deb-src http://bertram.ifrance.com ./

Then, as root, do:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install tme

and you're done!

N.B.: The tme-music, libguichan0, and libguichan0-dev packages are also
provided in this repository.
