3) Notes


1. Installing The Mana World and Dependencies
=============================================

N.B: XXX is a version number.

The Mana World Debian Package can be installed under the Debian Testing and
Unstable (Sarge/Sid). In order to have Mana World working, you'll need packages
for SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, libxml2, libphysfs and libguichan.

To install the dependencies, you can do type (as root):

    apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2 libsdl-image1.2 libxml2 libphysfs-1.0-0

Guichan can be found at :

http://guichan.sourceforge.net/downloads.shtml

After downloading it, you can install it by typing as root :

    dpkg -i libguichan_XXX_i386.deb
    
We try to release a Debian Package as soon as there a monthly release,
you can download it at http://www.themanaworld.org,
and then install it by typing :

    dpkg -i tmw_XXX_i386.deb

Type tmw as a normal user to play ! (Enjoy !)

2. Creating a Debian Package using DebHelper Tools
==================================================

You'll need the gcc, g++ and dev packages of dependencies :

   apt-get install gcc g++ libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev

And the debhelper tools :

   apt-get install dh-make fakeroot dpkg-dev build-essentials

Download tmw from CVS using the command (You'll need CVS installed on your system) :

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/themanaworld co -P tmw

Rename the tmw folder into tmw-XXX and open a console in it.
You can now type :
 
    fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

The package will create itself, including sources and diffs. You only need deb file.

Install it :

    dpkg -i tmw_XXXXXX_i386.deb

(If you've got a previous one already installed with the same version number,
don't forget to remove it with :)

    apt-get remove tmw

(Don't worry, you configuration files are not removed...)

And now the final step : type 'tmw' as a normal user in a shell and
you're in !!! 

KDE/Gnome menu entries are created in Arcade Games upon installation.

(Don't forget : To create a new account, add a '_M' after your account name the first time. After that just type your account name normally...)

3. Notes
========

A Debian Repository has been created.

Simply add in your /etc/apt/sources.list file :

	deb http://www.themanaworld.org/files/debrepo ./
	deb-src http://www.themanaworld.org/files/debrepo ./

Then, as root, do :

	apt-get update
	apt-get install tmw

and you're done !
