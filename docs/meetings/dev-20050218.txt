Minutes of the TMW Dev Meeting at Friday, 18th of February, 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------

Presence: Hammerbear, ElvenProgrammer, zenogais, Rotonen, maci
Timespan: 0.75 hours (21:00-21:45 GMT+1)


* We agreed to try a monthly release schedule. So with 0.0.9 released on 30th
  of Januari, 0.0.10 is scheduled by the end of this month, with the next
  version the month after that, etc. This should remove any doubt about when
  the next release is from both team members and players.

* With the 0.0.10 release less than 2 weeks away, we have still set the
  following set of goals to be reached by then, on top of changes already made
  since 0.0.9:

  - PhysicsFS usage for loading data from packages (zenogais)
  - XML map loading so that Tiled is supported (Hammerbear)
  - New GUI look (Bertram)
  - More functional inventory/equipment (ElvenProgrammer)
  - New tileset (the artists)
  - New, expanded, city map (Chetic)

  These are all important milestones in the development of The Mana World,
  and they don't go too far in the sense that things will need to be re-done
  a great deal when we start working on our own server. Whatever isn't finished
  by the end of this month will have to wait for 0.0.11 or 0.1.0.

* If you haven't noticed already, we have a new team member, his name is
  Kyokai. He's been writing on the forums, wiki and has been in discussion on
  IRC, in order to involve everybody who would like to get involved in the
  planning of our own skills and advancement system. A general concensus seems
  to be almost reached, with specific parts still being discussed. Pretty soon
  Kyokai could start to implement this system. Be sure to stay informed about
  this development if you care about where TMW is heading in this area.

* Rotonen is in need of a co-director in the art department. Rotonen is
  currently the central contact point for the artists. The co-director will
  have to know what needs to be done and what has been assigned to each artist.
  The most important part may be to comment on the work of the artists, to
  answer their questions and to give them directions.

* maci asked wether Tiled has a feature to export the map as an image, and this
  feature is indeed available. It would be nice if the result could be used to
  create a nice looking minimap of the area.

* Elven Programmer added an interesting part about server architecture in
  docs/architecture.txt. Anybody who's interested or involved in development
  of the server part should read this.
