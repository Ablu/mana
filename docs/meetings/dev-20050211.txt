Minutes of the TMW Dev Meeting at Friday, 11th of February, 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------

Presence: Rotonen, Hammerbear, ElvenProgrammer
Timespan: 0.75 hours (21:00-21:45 GMT+1)


* We will continue with server planning/design while working on adding basic
  features to the client.

* Hammerbear should implement .tmx map loading using libxml2, after it's been
  verified wether this will work with Dev-C++.

* It's been agreed to move AUTHORS, README, COPYING, etc. files to their more
  common location in the root of the project tree.

* Planning for the new server will also require us to start trying to
  specify/define objects and beings in XML. They have lots of properties as
  defined in server.txt, and we need to work towards a convenient format to
  store these properties.

* Release 0.1.0 is planned to be the last eAthena release with the basics
  functional. After that we'll be working towards our own server, which when
  finished will form 0.2.0 release.

* Rotonen promises to have a lot of time for The Mana World in the middle
  of March, and even more the beginning of June. :-)

* In the graphics department:

  - It's important the desert tileset is expanded so that we can map the area
    around the city. Also the tileset needs to be converted to the higher
    resolution we're currently using. Finally tiles need to be added for a
    market and other buildings.

  - Complete a high resolution player set.

* Rotonen can make sounds after he buys a new microphone. As for music, Rotonen
  pointed out we have to decide what kind of atmospherical element suits each
  environment.
