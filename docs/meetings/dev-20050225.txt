Minutes of the TMW Dev Meeting at Friday, 25th of February, 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------

Presence: Rotonen, Chetic, ElvenProgrammer, Mra
Timespan: 0.75 hours (21:00-21:45 GMT+1)


* Rotonen reported no news from art development, but he said he will leave his
  tasks to Kyokai since his final exams are approaching.

* Chetic, even if complaining about missing tiles, is working on maps and
  already created a base structure for the new city of Amzeroth.

* Mra decided to start working on item drops.

* Since there was not much activity and Hammerbear was missing, I'll define
  what we will discuss in the next meeting. I'd like every developer to be
  there.

  - First of all we should discuss if we need to open a new project on SF for
    the server. We could use the CVS to store the development docs and the
    database to create an online database to check items as
    http://www.euro-ro.net/game/items/

  - Planned features for the client:
        * trading
        * parties
        * long range weapons
        * magic attacks
        * defining gui for long range attacks (target below monster)
        * defining gui to trade, equip and inventory (how to use them by
          keyboard)
        * clothing weapons (also graphic part)

  - Define a server development roadmap. (maybe an eta too?)

  - About the old server, we need to define more scripts and discuss about the
    next step for world development.

  - Server control panel: ingame or external application through an open port.
