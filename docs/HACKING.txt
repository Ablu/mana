With multiple coders working on the same source files, there needs to be a
standard specifying how code is written down. Not doing so can cause quite some
annoyance for certain coders and easily creates more version conflicts than
necessary.

* Code is indented using 4 spaces, no tabs.

* Control constructs like this:

  if (condition) {
  }
  else {
  }

  for (init; condition; step) {
  }

  while (condition) {
  }

  /*
   * Documentation about behaviour
   */
  void function(param1, param2) {
  }

  class TheClass : public TheSubclass {
  };

  Ending parenthesis may be on next line for clarity.

* Use of whitespace example:

  x = ((5 + 4) * 3) / 1.5;

* Agreement on function/class/variable/method/member naming pending.
