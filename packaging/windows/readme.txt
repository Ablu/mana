HOW TO BUILD THE INSTALLER

First time setup

* Install NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net)
* Install UPX (http://upx.sourceforge.net/)
  (the script expects upx to be in a "upx" subdirectory right here)

Building the installer

* Make sure TMW is compiled at the right version
* Make sure the correct DLLs are in place
* Make sure the latest music files are in place
* Make sure setup.nsi mentions the right TMW version
* Right-click setup.nsi and select "Compile NSIS Script"
