To run aethyra double click on aethyra.exe in this folder.

There are a couple of known bugs you might run into first run...

aethyra.exe might complain about not being able to create it's
configuration folder. If it crashes out just run it again.

You may also have issues with the aethyra crashing with lots of
updates. Again just run it again and it should continue the update
from where it left off.

To install the client, just copy this folder to your Program Files
folder and add a shortcut to aethyra.exe to your Start Menu.

For any further questions pop onto the forums at http://forums.aethyra.com/
especially the Windows Way forum, or pop onto the IRC channel #aethyra on the
FreeNode network

If you don't have an IRC client you can still get to the
channel through this page: http://www.aethyra.com/ircchat.html

Thanks for playing from the Aethyra team.
